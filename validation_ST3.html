  <h1>Validation Page – Lasal Nethsara</h1>

  <section id="feedback-validation">
    <h2>Feedback Page Validation</h2>
    <p>The Feedback page was validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. No errors were found, and only minor accessibility warnings were issued.</p>

    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>Ensuring all inputs had correct label associations and proper HTML5 syntax helped pass the validator easily. This reinforced the value of writing clean, semantic HTML from the start.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="team-validation">
    <h2>Team Page Validation</h2>
    <p>This page was validated successfully with all structural and accessibility standards met. ARIA roles were reviewed and adjusted to avoid deprecated values.</p>

    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>Initial validation failed due to incorrect use of <code>role="listitem"</code>. After reviewing the standard, I replaced it with correct HTML semantics, which resolved the issue.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="content-validation">
    <h2>Content Page ST3 Validation</h2>
    <p>The SDG 6 content page passed all HTML5 validation checks. Structure and internal linking were verified.</p>

    <h3>Reflection:</h3>
    <p>One challenge was ensuring that internal anchor links were valid and uniquely identified by IDs. I learned the importance of matching <code>href="#section-id"</code> with a corresponding element in the document.</p>
